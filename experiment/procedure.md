<b>Materials Required:</b><br>
● Salicylic acid<br>
● 0.1 N HCl<br>
● Ferric nitrate solution<br>
● Distilled water<br>
● Spectrophotometer<br>
● Cuvettes, test tubes, beakers, conical flasks<br>
● Pipettes and measuring cylinders<br>
● Digital weighing balance<br>
● Water baths maintained at 40°C, 60°C, and 70°C<br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
1. Prepare a standard solution by dissolving 100 mg of salicylic acid in 100 mL distilled water to obtain a 1 mg/mL standard solution.<br>
2. Prepare an acid solution by adding 8.5 mL concentrated HCl to distilled water and make up to 100 mL (handle with care).<br>
3. For the calibration curve, pipette known concentrations of salicylic acid into test tubes, add ferric nitrate reagent, mix well, and measure absorbance at 540–547 nm.<br>
4. Plot absorbance versus concentration to obtain the calibration curve.<br>
5. Prepare an aspirin solution of known concentration and incubate in water baths at 40°C, 60°C, and 70°C for 10, 20, and 30 minutes.<br>
6. Withdraw aliquots at each time interval, cool them, add ferric nitrate reagent, and measure absorbance.<br>
7. Calculate the percentage of undecomposed drug and plot log(% drug undecomposed) vs. time to confirm first-order kinetics.<br>
8. From the slope, determine rate constant (k) at each temperature.<br>
9. Plot log k vs. 1/T (Arrhenius plot) to determine activation energy (Ea).<br>
10. Estimate shelf life (t₉₀) using the first-order equation.
