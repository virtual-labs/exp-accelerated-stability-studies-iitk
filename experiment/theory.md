<b>Theory: </b><br> 
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of moisture or heat to yield salicylic acid and acetic acid. The reaction is accelerated at higher temperatures and follows first-order kinetics, making it suitable for accelerated stability testing.<br> 

The concentration of salicylic acid formed can be determined spectrophotometrically using ferric nitrate, which reacts with the phenolic group of salicylic acid to produce a purple complex measurable at 540–547 nm.<br>

The first-order degradation rate constant (k) is calculated using the equation:<br>
log(% Drug Undecomposed) = -kt / 2.303 + log C₀<br>

The Arrhenius equation is used to calculate activation energy (Ea):<br>
log k = log A - Ea / (2.303RT)<br>

By plotting log k vs. 1/T, the slope of the straight line gives -Ea / 2.303R, from which the activation energy can be determined. This data allows estimation of the shelf life (t₉₀) of aspirin at room temperature.<br>
